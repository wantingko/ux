        <h2>The client: Southwest Florida Community Foundation</h2>
        <p>Southwest Florida Community Foundation, also known as Collaboratory, is a non-profit organization that helps fund and connect other organizations within the Southwest Florida region.</p>
        <p>Organizations in this region are driven by various causes ranging from Animals, Climate Change, Community Design, Education, and many more.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The project: Building Collaboratory Online</h2>
        <p>Our client is looking forward to an information hub and centralized location online to enhance connectivity outside of Collaboratory’s physical space.</p>
        <p>The web-based application would be a new means of connection and a supplement for existing in-person and online gatherings.</p>

        <p>We created an online space that allows users to post and navigate content such as community events. Users can also search for non-profits and network with individuals involved in different organizations.</p>

        <h2>Agile project management</h2>
        <p>We followed the agile scrum framework to help us manage the project. After each sprint, we would have a working MVP product to showcase on sprint reviews with our client involved. This helped us identify blockers, ensure we don’t delay the entire development process, and most importantly, communicate what we have achieved.</p>

        <p>Throughout the sprints, we used Airtable to store user stories and track progress. We leveraged customizable features to display feature information, priority, acceptance criteria, and velocity estimates.</p>

        <h2>3 interviews with end users</h2>
        <p>After collecting background information from our clients, we had a better understanding of the issues that people were facing. Without a user-friendly tool that allows people to connect outside of formal gatherings, people rely much on our clients and that has been a bottleneck for them to network freely. </p>

        <p class="caption">User needs collected from stakeholders</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>To further validate what we gathered from our clients, we conducted 3 remote interviews to learn more about participants’ first hand experience with the platforms used, communication preferences, and pain points. The interviews helped us identify what needs were not being met.</p>

        <h2>Comparative analysis</h2>
        <p>We identified desirable features from conversations with our client and grouped them into “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves.” We also collected tools previously used from user interviews to see where the tools fell short or worked well. With that, we documented findings on a Miro board and facilitated conversations with our clients as we moved forward to prioritize the MVP features.</p>

        <p>Among 5 of us in the team, some had more experience with Python while others are more comfortable with javascript frameworks. To leverage technical skills everyone brought to the table, we ended up deciding to go with a hybrid React frontend and Django backend method with Mariah DB storing user data.</p>

    <div class="container content">
        <h5 class="section-tag">Takeaways</h5>
        <h2>Adopt remote agile</h2>
        <p>Agile practices worked well asynchronously! As a group, we benefited from remote pair coding sessions, virtual standups, and frequent Slack communication. It wasn’t ideal, but we embraced the opportunity to leverage different technologies and time differences to make things work.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Look before you jump</h2>
        <p>Before jumping into writing any code, devote time to understanding the feature, exploring potential third-party packages, and going through tutorials in a separate testing environment. This can save a ton of time from writing non-usable code that could impact other parts of the project.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Detailed handoff documentation is a must</h2>
        <p>Documenting findings, design iterations, and user feedback is a great practice. Chances are we all forget how decisions are made when we move on to development. This keeps the team on the same page when developing features.</p>
